                    <p class="lead">Cuddlefish is a revolutionary robotic avatar concept that enables safe physical interactions for people separated by distance.</p>
                    <p>We demonstrate a new robotic avatar in which pilots can embody a fish-like form, "swimming" through indoor spaces to interact, play, and accompany others remotely. Our soft flapping-wing floating avatar combines bioinspired design with cutting-edge technology to create lifelike, organic movements that enhance the sense of presence.</p>
                    <p>By mimicking the flapping flight of birds and the graceful swimming of aquatic creatures, pilots can control the avatar through intuitive body movements while engaging in meaningful interactions through the avatar's soft body and wings.</p>
